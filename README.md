# flutter_funk

A Flutter Project to get you started for most without doing the BoilerPlate stuff again and again.

## Getting Started

Will  Update more pages as I encounter them during my journey.Feels like I missed a few things,you add them xD.

Here are a few screenshots for the screens in the app.If one fits good for your need,just copy the code and start using it.No external Dependencies.Purely based on Flutter sdk.
